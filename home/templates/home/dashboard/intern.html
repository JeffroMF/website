		<h2 id="feedback">Internship Feedback</h2>
		<p>The Outreachy organizers want to ensure that all interns get the support they need from their mentors. You will be asked to provide mentor feedback on specific dates, which coincide with when your mentor is giving feedback on your internship efforts.</p>
		<p>The feedback form also collects information about how you view your own progress in the internship. This is important to provide, especially if your mentor has previously asked for an extension for your internship. The feedback form also offers a way for interns to request additional help or support.</p>
		<p>The feedback is private and completely optional. Your feedback about your mentors will only be seen by the Outreachy organizers. We will discuss the feedback with you before contacting your mentors about how to improve their mentorship.</p>

		<h2>Intern Payment Schedule</h2>
		{% include 'home/snippet/payment_schedule.html' %}
	{% endwith %}

	<p>Please note that your payment may be delayed for several reasons:
	<ul>
		<li>You did not supply a W8-BEN or W-9 form promptly.</li>
		<li>Your payment account was in another person's name, and you needed to complete a third-party payment form.
		That form must be approved by the Software Freedom Conservancy's Executive Director, Karen Sandler.
		Payment cannot be processed until the third party payment form is approved.
		Please notify SFC accounting ASAP if you have a different name on your account than the legal name you signed your contract with.
		</li>
		<li>You have an extension for your internship.
		If your internship was extended at the midpoint, your midpoint payment will be delayed by that amount of time.
		This will also move your final payment by the same amount of time (or more, if your internship is extended again).
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>If you do not think your payment has been delayed for any of the reasons above, please wait at least ten days past the payment deadline before contacting the SFC accounting.</p>
